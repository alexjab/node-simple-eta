# node-simple-eta
An approximate, API-less, ETA library

This library gives you the ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) to get from a starting point to a destination point;
the ETA returned is simply based on an approximate of the distance between the two points and speed.
The distance is the [Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry) between the two points.
